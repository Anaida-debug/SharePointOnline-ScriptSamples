A short console application that enables versioning for all the libraries and lists in the whole tenant.

 

It uses recurrence to find all sites in all site collections and then goes through all the lists.

For some lists, enabling version may not be possible and you will receive a notification of that.

At the end, the application generates a report, which you view in Excel.
