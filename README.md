# AllGalleryScriptsSamples

Over 200 SharePoint Online scripts 
* fixing issues
* providing reports 
* extra settings not available via UI
* bulk updates

The scripts use Powershell, C#, CSOM and REST. They include copies of existing scripts from Technet Gallery years 2013-2019 - the transfer is in progress.

Most of them were tested and verified by hundreds and thousands of users of Technet Gallery. 

Their new home at GitHub is still relatively recent, so if you find any issues, please do let me know. I appreciate every comment and every feedback.
