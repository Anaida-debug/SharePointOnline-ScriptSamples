A simple script for SharePoint Online that activates or de-activates a feature for a site collection. You need to have the required permissions for the site collection and know the feature guid. The list of guids can be found here:

Before running the script, verify the paths to SharePoint Online SDK:

 

```PowerShell
Add-Type -Path "c:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\Web Server Extensions\15\ISAPI\Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.dll"  
Add-Type -Path "c:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\Web Server Extensions\15\ISAPI\Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Runtime.dll"  
```
 

Optionally, you can edit these two lines so that the script doesn'task you for credentials at runtime:

 

```PowerShell
$siteUrl = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/mysitecollection‚Äù 
$username = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter admin@tenant.onmicrosoft.com"
```
 

During its execution the script will inform you, when the feature has been changed.
