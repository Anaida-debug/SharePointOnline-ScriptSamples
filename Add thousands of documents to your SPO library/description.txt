The application is mainly for SharePoint Online test environments. 

It creates mock data for a library of your choice so that you can test synchronization and SharePoint Online performance.

It creates:

-Word Documents with random content from Latin texts

-Excel Spreadsheets with random number of Sheets but no content

-PowerPoint presentations

-files that will be corrupt (as said above, for testing purposes)

 

You can create unlimited* number of items. Of course the more items you choose, the longer it will run. Depending on your environment, it creates 100 documents per 20seconds. 

 

Works for OneDrive for Business as well.
